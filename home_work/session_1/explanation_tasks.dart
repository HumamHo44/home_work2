/* 
 * 1. Explain the purpose of the main function in Dart.
 - The main function is the starting point for any standalone Dart program, 
 - as the commands inside it are executed first when the program is run.
 */


/* 
 * 2. Describe the difference between var, dynamic, and explicitly typed variables in Dart.
 
 -var: The type of a variable is determined automatically from the first value assigned to it.
  Its value can be changed later but of the same type.
 

 var name = 'humam';
name = 10; false



dynamic: accepts any type of value and its type can be changed during operation.

dynamic name = 'humam';
name = 10; true




explicitly typed variables:
The type of a variable is explicitly specified when defining it, for example:
int age = 20;

To increase code clarity and prevent errors.
